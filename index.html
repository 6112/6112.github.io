  This is my homepage and portfolio. This website contains links to demos for
  some of the personal projects I am working on, or have worked on in the past.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
  I am studying at École Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada. I know French and
  English. When it comes to programming, I have played around with several
  paradigms and programming languages. I really like programming in C,
  JavaScript, Perl, and Haskell, but I am also familiar with a few others. Web
  development is something I really like, especially when it concerns real-time,
  interactive web applications, or games.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am currently studying in <em>Software Engineering</em> at University. I have
  a CEGEP diploma in <em>Computer Science and Mathematics</em>. The main project
  I made in CEGEP, a real-time, 2D fluid simulator, is available on the Projects
  page.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have spent quite some time solving some of the algorithmic problems that can
  be found at <a href="projecteuler.net">projecteuler.net</a>. The solutions to
  those that I have solved can be found in 
  <a href="//github.com/6112/project-euler">one of my GitHub repositories</a>.
